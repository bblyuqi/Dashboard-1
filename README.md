You are working as a Data Analyst at an e-commerce company with operations across several Southeast Asian countries. 
You have been tasked with analyzing the factors that influence monthly sales volume. 
The data collected includes the following variables:
y = monthly sales volume (in thousands of USD), 
x1 = number of website visitors per month,
x2 = number of monthly transactions,
x3 = average number of items per transaction, 
x4 = customer satisfaction rating (scale 1-10),
x5 = number of online advertisements run per month.
The data can be seen in the code (with the object name "example data")

Question
1.	Using the provided data, estimate a multiple linear regression equation to predict the monthly sales volume (y) based on the given variables (x1 to x5).
2.	Design a basic concept for an interactive dashboard using R Shiny that allows users to input predictor data (x1 to x5) and receive an estimate for sales.
3.	Briefly discuss the methodology for evaluating the regression model you build, including tests for assumptions,
    significance testing of coefficients, and how you would interpret these coefficients.
5.	How could the results from this model be used to improve marketing strategy and increase sales?
   
Additional Questions:
a.	If the company wishes to increase sales, which variable should they focus on improving based on your model?
b.	can you check if there is a significant interaction between the number of website visitors and the number of ads run that affects sales?
